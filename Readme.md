# 🛠️ Multi-Utility Checker App

This project is a collection of **three simple and interactive tools** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1. **Roman Numeral Checker** – Validates whether a given number is a valid Roman numeral.
2. **Palindrome Checker** – Checks if a given word, phrase, or number is a palindrome.
3. **Telephone Number Validator** – Validates US-format telephone numbers.

These projects are part of my learning journey through the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course**.  
I have also designed a **simple, responsive UI** for a better user experience.
